## Arithmetic Operators

TensorFlow provides several operations that you can use to add basic arithmetic operators to your graph.

### `tf.add(x, y, name=None)` <a id="add"></a>

Returns x + y element-wise.

_NOTE_: Add supports broadcasting. AddN does not.

#### Args:

* **`x`**: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`, `float64`, `uint8`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `complex64`, `complex128`, `string`.
* **`y`**: A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`.
* **`name`**: A name for the operation \(optional\).

#### Returns:

A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.

### `tf.sub(x, y, name=None)` <a id="sub"></a>

Returns x - y element-wise.

#### Args:

Returns x \* y element-wise.

#### Args:

* **`x`**: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`, `float64`, `uint8`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `complex64`, `complex128`.
* **`y`**: A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `x`.
* **`name`**: A name for the operation \(optional\).

#### Returns:

### `tf.div(x, y, name=None)` <a id="div"></a>

Returns x / y element-wise.

#### Args:

* **`x`**: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `half`, `float32`, `float64`, `uint8`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `complex64`, `complex128`.

* **`name`**: A name for the operation \(optional\).

#### Returns:

A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.

### `tf.truediv(x, y, name=None)` <a id="truediv"></a>

Divides x / y elementwise, always producing floating point results.

The same as `tf.div` for floating point arguments, but casts integer arguments to floating point before dividing so that the result is always floating point. This op is generated by normal `x / y` division in Python 3 and in Python 2.7 with `from __future__ import division`. If you want integer division that rounds down, use `x // y` or `tf.floordiv`.

`x` and `y` must have the same numeric type. If the inputs are floating point, the output will have the same type. If the inputs are integral, the inputs are cast to `float32` for `int8` and `int16` and `float64` for `int32` and `int64` \(matching the behavior of Numpy\).

#### Args:

* **`x`**: `Tensor` numerator of numeric type.
* **`y`**: `Tensor` denominator of numeric type.
* **`name`**: A name for the operation \(optional\).

#### Returns:

`x / y` evaluated in floating point.

#### Raises:

* **`TypeError`**: If `x` and `y` have different dtypes.

### `tf.floordiv(x, y, name=None)` <a id="floordiv"></a>

Divides `x / y` elementwise, rounding down for floating point.

The same as `tf.div(x,y)` for integers, but uses `tf.floor(tf.div(x,y))` for floating point arguments so that the result is always an integer \(though possibly an integer represented as floating point\). This op is generated by `x // y` floor division in Python 3 and in Python 2.7 with `from __future__ import division`.

Note that for efficiency, `floordiv` uses C semantics for negative numbers \(unlike Python and Numpy\).

`x` and `y` must have the same type, and the result will have the same type as well.

#### Args:

* **`x`**: `Tensor` numerator of real numeric type.
* **`y`**: `Tensor` denominator of real numeric type.
* **`name`**: A name for the operation \(optional\).

#### Returns:

`x / y` rounded down \(except possibly towards zero for negative integers\).

#### Returns:

A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `x`.

### `tf.cross(a, b, name=None)` <a id="cross"></a>

`a` and `b` must be the same shape; they can either be simple 3-element vectors, or any shape where the innermost dimension is 3. In the latter case, each pair of corresponding 3-element vectors is cross-multiplied independently.

#### Args:

* **`a`**: A `Tensor`. Must be one of the following types: `float32`, `float64`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint8`, `int16`, `int8`, `uint16`, `half`.

* **`b`**: A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `a`.

   Another tensor, of same type and shape as `a`.

* **`name`**: A name for the operation \(optional\).

#### Returns:

A `Tensor`. Has the same type as `a`. Pairwise cross product of the vectors in `a` and `b`.

### `tf.batch_matrix_band_part(input, num_lower, num_upper, name=None)` <a id="batch_matrix_band_part"></a>

Copy a tensor setting everything outside a central band in each innermost matrix

to zero.

The `band` part is computed as follows: Assume `input` has `k` dimensions `[I, J, K, ..., M, N]`, then the output is a tensor with the same shape where

`band[i, j, k, ..., m, n] = in_band(m, n) * input[i, j, k, ..., m, n]`.

The indicator function 'in\_band\(m, n\)`is one if`\(num\_lower &lt; 0 \|\| \(m-n\) &lt;= num\_lower\)\) && \(num\_upper &lt; 0 \|\| \(n-m\) &lt;= num\_upper\)\`, and zero otherwise.

                 [-2, -1,  0, 1]

                                             [-1,  0,  1, 2]
                                             [ 0, -1,  0, 1]
                                             [ 0,  0, -1, 0]],

                                            [ 0, -2, -1, 0]]

`output[i1,..., ik, i1,..., ik] = diagonal[i1, ..., ik]` and 0 everywhere else.

For example:

```text
# 'diagonal' is [1, 2, 3, 4]
tf.diag(diagonal) ==> [[1, 0, 0, 0]
                       [0, 2, 0, 0]

The returned tensor's dimension i will correspond to the input dimension `perm[i]`. If `perm` is not given, it is set to \(n-1...0\), where n is the rank of the input tensor. Hence by default, this operation performs a regular matrix transpose on 2-D input Tensors.

For example:

```python
# 'x' is [[1 2 3]
#         [4 5 6]]
tf.transpose(x) ==> [[1 4]
                     [2 5]

   Shape is `[..., M, M]`.

* **`rhs`**: A `Tensor`. Must have the same type as `matrix`.

### `tf.matrix_solve_ls(matrix, rhs, l2_regularizer=0.0, fast=True, name=None)` <a id="matrix_solve_ls"></a>

Solves a linear least-squares problem.

Below we will use the following notation `matrix`=\\(A \in \Re^{m \times n}\\), `rhs`=\\(B \in \Re^{m \times k}\\), `output`=\\(X \in \Re^{n \times k}\\), `l2_regularizer`=\\(\lambda\\).

If `fast` is `True`, then the solution is computed by solving the normal equations using Cholesky decomposition. Specifically, if \\(m \ge n\\) then \\(X = \(A^T A + \lambda I\)^{-1} A^T B\\), which solves the regularized least-squares problem \\(X = \mathrm{argmin}_{Z \in \Re^{n \times k}} \|\|A Z - B\|\|\_F^2 + \lambda \|\|Z\|\|\_F^2\\). If \\(m \lt n\\) then `output` is computed as \\(X = A^T \(A A^T + \lambda I\)^{-1} B\\), which \(for \\(\lambda = 0\\)\) is the minimum-norm solution to the under-determined linear system, i.e. \\(X = \mathrm{argmin}_{Z \in \Re^{n \times k}} \|\|Z\|\|_F^2 \\), subject to \\(A Z = B\\). Notice that the fast path is only numerically stable when \\(A\\) is numerically full rank and has a condition number \\(\mathrm{cond}\(A\) \lt \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{mach}}}\\) or \\(\lambda\\) is sufficiently large.

If `fast` is `False` then the solution is computed using the rank revealing QR decomposition with column pivoting. This will always compute a least-squares solution that minimizes the residual norm \\(\|\|A X - B\|\|\_F^2 \\), even when \\(A\\) is rank deficient or ill-conditioned. Notice: The current version does not compute a minimum norm solution. If `fast` is `False` then `l2_regularizer` is ignored.

#### Args:

* **`matrix`**: 2-D `Tensor` of shape `[M, N]`.
* **`rhs`**: 2-D `Tensor` of shape is `[M, K]`.
* **`l2_regularizer`**: 0-D  `double` `Tensor`. Ignored if `fast=False`.
* **`fast`**: bool. Defaults to `True`.
* **`name`**: string, optional name of the operation.

#### Returns:

* **`output`**: Matrix of shape `[N, K]` containing the matrix that solves

   `matrix * output = rhs` in the least-squares sense.

### `tf.batch_matrix_solve_ls(matrix, rhs, l2_regularizer=0.0, fast=True, name=None)` <a id="batch_matrix_solve_ls"></a>

Solves multiple linear least-squares problems.

`matrix` is a tensor of shape `[..., M, N]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions form `M`-by-`N` matrices. Rhs is a tensor of shape `[..., M, K]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions form `M`-by-`K` matrices. The computed output is a `Tensor` of shape `[..., N, K]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions form `M`-by-`K` matrices that solve the equations `matrix[..., :, :] * output[..., :, :] = rhs[..., :, :]` in the least squares sense.

Below we will use the following notation for each pair of matrix and right-hand sides in the batch:

`matrix`=\\(A \in \Re^{m \times n}\\), `rhs`=\\(B \in \Re^{m \times k}\\), `output`=\\(X \in \Re^{n \times k}\\), `l2_regularizer`=\\(\lambda\\).

If `fast` is `True`, then the solution is computed by solving the normal equations using Cholesky decomposition. Specifically, if \\(m \ge n\\) then \\(X = \(A^T A + \lambda I\)^{-1} A^T B\\), which solves the least-squares problem \\(X = \mathrm{argmin}_{Z \in \Re^{n \times k}} \|\|A Z - B\|\|\_F^2 + \lambda \|\|Z\|\|\_F^2\\). If \\(m \lt n\\) then `output` is computed as \\(X = A^T \(A A^T + \lambda I\)^{-1} B\\), which \(for \\(\lambda = 0\\)\) is the minimum-norm solution to the under-determined linear system, i.e. \\(X = \mathrm{argmin}_{Z \in \Re^{n \times k}} \|\|Z\|\|_F^2 \\), subject to \\(A Z = B\\). Notice that the fast path is only numerically stable when \\(A\\) is numerically full rank and has a condition number \\(\mathrm{cond}\(A\) \lt \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{mach}}}\\) or\\(\lambda\\) is sufficiently large.

If `fast` is `False` an algorithm based on the numerically robust complete orthogonal decomposition is used. This computes the minimum-norm least-squares solution, even when \\(A\\) is rank deficient. This path is typically 6-7 times slower than the fast path. If `fast` is `False` then `l2_regularizer` is ignored.

#### Args:

* **`matrix`**: `Tensor` of shape `[..., M, N]`.
* **`rhs`**: `Tensor` of shape `[..., M, K]`.
* **`l2_regularizer`**: 0-D `double` `Tensor`. Ignored if `fast=False`.
* **`fast`**: bool. Defaults to `True`.
* **`name`**: string, optional name of the operation.

#### Returns:

* **`output`**: `Tensor` of shape `[..., N, K]` whose inner-most 2 dimensions form

   `M`-by-`K` matrices that solve the equations

   `matrix[..., :, :] * output[..., :, :] = rhs[..., :, :]` in the least

   squares sense.

## Segmentation

TensorFlow provides several operations that you can use to perform common math computations on tensor segments. Here a segmentation is a partitioning of a tensor along the first dimension, i.e. it defines a mapping from the first dimension onto `segment_ids`. The `segment_ids` tensor should be the size of the first dimension, `d0`, with consecutive IDs in the range `0` to `k`, where `k<d0`. In particular, a segmentation of a matrix tensor is a mapping of rows to segments.

For example:

```python
c = tf.constant([[1,2,3,4], [-1,-2,-3,-4], [5,6,7,8]])
tf.segment_sum(c, tf.constant([0, 0, 1]))
  ==>  [[0 0 0 0]

```

### `tf.listdiff(x, y, name=None)` <a id="listdiff"></a>

Computes the difference between two lists of numbers or strings.

Given a list `x` and a list `y`, this operation returns a list `out` that represents all values that are in `x` but not in `y`. The returned list `out` is sorted in the same order that the numbers appear in `x` \(duplicates are preserved\). This operation also returns a list `idx` that represents the position of each `out` element in `x`. In other words:

`out[i] = x[idx[i]] for i in [0, 1, ..., len(out) - 1]`

For example, given this input:

```text
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
y = [1, 3, 5]
```

This operation would return:

```text
out ==> [2, 4, 6]
idx ==> [1, 3, 5]
```

* **`idx`**: A `Tensor` of type `int32`. 1-D. Positions of `x` values preserved in `out`.

### `tf.where(input, name=None)` <a id="where"></a>

Returns locations of true values in a boolean tensor.

This operation returns the coordinates of true elements in `input`. The coordinates are returned in a 2-D tensor where the first dimension \(rows\) represents the number of true elements, and the second dimension \(columns\) represents the coordinates of the true elements. Keep in mind, the shape of the output tensor can vary depending on how many true values there are in `input`. Indices are output in row-major order.

For example:

```text
# 'input' tensor is [[True, False]
#                    [True, False]]
# 'input' has two true values, so output has two coordinates.
# 'input' has rank of 2, so coordinates have two indices.
where(input) ==> [[0, 0],
                  [1, 0]]

# `input` tensor is [[[True, False]
#                     [True, False]]
#                    [[False, True]
#                     [False, True]]
#                    [[False, False]
#                     [False, True]]]
# 'input' has 5 true values, so output has 5 coordinates.
# 'input' has rank of 3, so coordinates have three indices.
where(input) ==> [[0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 1, 0],
                  [1, 0, 1],
                  [1, 1, 1],
                  [2, 1, 1]]
```

#### Args:

* **`input`**: A `Tensor` of type `bool`.
* **`name`**: A name for the operation \(optional\).

#### Returns:

A `Tensor` of type `int64`.

### `tf.unique(x, name=None)` <a id="unique"></a>

Finds unique elements in a 1-D tensor.

This operation returns a tensor `y` containing all of the unique elements of `x` sorted in the same order that they occur in `x`. This operation also returns a tensor `idx` the same size as `x` that contains the index of each value of `x` in the unique output `y`. In other words:

`y[idx[i]] = x[i] for i in [0, 1,...,rank(x) - 1]`

For example:

```text
# tensor 'x' is [1, 1, 2, 4, 4, 4, 7, 8, 8]
y, idx = unique(x)
y ==> [1, 2, 4, 7, 8]
idx ==> [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]
```

#### Args:

* **`x`**: A `Tensor`. 1-D.
* **`name`**: A name for the operation \(optional\).

### `tf.edit_distance(hypothesis, truth, normalize=True, name='edit_distance')` <a id="edit_distance"></a>

Computes the Levenshtein distance between sequences.

This operation takes variable-length sequences \(`hypothesis` and `truth`\), each provided as a `SparseTensor`, and computes the Levenshtein distance. You can normalize the edit distance by length of `truth` by setting `normalize` to true.

For example, given the following input:

```python
# 'hypothesis' is a tensor of shape `[2, 1]` with variable-length values:
#   (0,0) = ["a"]
#   (1,0) = ["b"]
hypothesis = tf.SparseTensor(
    [[0, 0, 0],
     [1, 0, 0]],
    ["a", "b"]
    (2, 1, 1))

# 'truth' is a tensor of shape `[2, 2]` with variable-length values:
#   (0,0) = []
#   (0,1) = ["a"]
#   (1,0) = ["b", "c"]
#   (1,1) = ["a"]
truth = tf.SparseTensor(
    [[0, 1, 0],
     [1, 0, 0],
     [1, 0, 1],
     [1, 1, 0]]
    ["a", "b", "c", "a"],
    (2, 2, 2))

normalize = True
```

This operation would return the following:

```python
# 'output' is a tensor of shape `[2, 2]` with edit distances normalized
# by 'truth' lengths.
output ==> [[inf, 1.0],  # (0,0): no truth, (0,1): no hypothesis
           [0.5, 1.0]]  # (1,0): addition, (1,1): no hypothesis
```

#### Args:

* **`hypothesis`**: A `SparseTensor` containing hypothesis sequences.
* **`truth`**: A `SparseTensor` containing truth sequences.
* **`normalize`**: A `bool`. If `True`, normalizes the Levenshtein distance by

   length of `truth.`

* **`name`**: A name for the operation \(optional\).

#### Returns:

A dense `Tensor` with rank `R - 1`, where R is the rank of the `SparseTensor` inputs `hypothesis` and `truth`.

#### Raises:

* **`TypeError`**: If either `hypothesis` or `truth` are not a `SparseTensor`.

### `tf.invert_permutation(x, name=None)` <a id="invert_permutation"></a>

Computes the inverse permutation of a tensor.

This operation computes the inverse of an index permutation. It takes a 1-D integer tensor `x`, which represents the indices of a zero-based array, and swaps each value with its index position. In other words, for an output tensor `y` and an input tensor `x`, this operation computes the following:

`y[x[i]] = i for i in [0, 1, ..., len(x) - 1]`

The values must include 0. There can be no duplicate values or negative values.

For example:

```text
# tensor `x` is [3, 4, 0, 2, 1]
invert_permutation(x) ==> [2, 4, 3, 0, 1]
```
